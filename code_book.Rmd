# Approch

1. read features.txt in, create df-data with each feature ad column name
2. read test data -- X_test.txt, X_train.txt to df-data
3. Subset df, keep mean(), std()
4. read subject_test.txt, subject_train.txt into df_subject -- ID the subject 
5. read y_test.txt, x_test.txt into df_excerise, mutate with text lable -- ID the exercise
6. merge df_subject, df_excerise, df-data
